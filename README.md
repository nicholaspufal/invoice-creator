## Set up

The codebase has been converted into a Ruby gem so you can just install it with:

```bash
  gem install invoice_creator
```

...and the binary should be available to you globally ðŸŽ‰

Just make sure to go into the gem's folder and edit the file `config.yml` so that it's tailored to
your needs - define your rate, date format, filename format, etc.

You can do `bundler open invoice_creator` for quick access to the gem's folder.

## Usage example

Let's say we want to create an invoice that represents 168 billable hours and has
invoice number set to 10:

```bash
./bin/invoice_creator create 168 --number 10
```
